A sophisticated simulation framework designed to optimize healthcare AI operations through evidence-based deployment strategies. By creating a "digital twin" of healthcare systems, we can evaluate AI implementation approaches and measure their operational impact before real-world deployment.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

**Dual-level architecture** (individual patients + hospital organizations) enables comprehensive operational assessment by modeling realistic healthcare AI deployment patterns and their systemic effects.

### System Components

- **Population Generation**: Create individuals with demographics
- **Hospital Assignment**: Distribute across healthcare facilities  
- **Temporal Evolution**: Incremental updates with hazard-based events
- **AI Deployment Optimization**: AI-guided interventions and operational strategies
- **Outcome Measurement**: Track individual and hospital operational metrics
- **Impact Analysis**: Apply causal inference methods to measure operational effectiveness

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pop-ml-sim.git
cd pop-ml-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from pop_ml_sim import SimulationFramework
from pop_ml_sim.config import load_config

# Load configuration
config = load_config()

# Initialize framework
sim = SimulationFramework(config)

# Run simulation
results = sim.run()

# Analyze operational impact
sim.analyze_operational_effects(results)
```

## 📋 Core Data Structures

### PersonState
```python
@dataclass
class PersonState:
    person_id: int          # Unique identifier
    hospital_id: int        # Assigned hospital
    age: float             # Current age in years
    alive: bool = True     # Survival status
    had_incident: bool = False  # Incident history
```

### HospitalState
```python
@dataclass
class HospitalState:
    hospital_id: int
    size_category: str  # 'small', 'medium', 'large'
    baseline_quality: float
    ai_adoption_propensity: float
```

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

### Hazard Functions

**Incident hazard (monthly rate):**
```
λ_incident(t | age, X) = base_hazard × exp(age_effect × (age - 50) / 10)
```

**Mortality hazard:**
```
λ_mortality(t | age, incident) = base_hazard × exp(age_effect × (age - 50) / 10) × incident_multiplier
```

**Discrete time probability conversion:**
```
P(event) = 1 - exp(-λ × Δt)
```
